## How to Play
Digger is a puzzle game in which you control an underground explorer searching for riches in treacherous underground mazes. 

The primary goal of Digger is to obtain all of the golden diamond tiles on the map while avoiding any hazards or enemies traversing the screen, all within the time limit and without running out of lives.

The game is controlled using the cursor keys, ESC to restart the current screen, and DEL to skip the current level andjump to the next.

The player can dig through any dirt tiles and push any purple boulders into empty spaces, but beware! Boulders as well as the golden diamonds can roll onto the player and crush them if the tiles around them are destroyed. 

Destroying tiles also risks releasing enemies trapped behind walls who can destroy the player if confronted recklessly. 

To win, one must pay careful attention to the layout of the screen and traverse to collect the diamonds in the safest way possible while having the reflexes to quickly react to any unexpected traps.
